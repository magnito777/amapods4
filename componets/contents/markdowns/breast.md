## Introduction

Postpartum breast infections, commonly known as mastitis, occur when bacteria enter the milk ducts of the breast, leading to inflammation and infection. This condition is most prevalent in the first six weeks after childbirth, particularly among breastfeeding mothers.

## Causes

Mastitis typically develops when bacteria, often from the skin, enter the milk ducts through cracked or sore nipples. Factors that can increase the risk of developing a breast infection include:

- **Cracked or sore nipples**: Improper breastfeeding techniques can lead to nipple damage.
- **Stagnation of milk**: Infrequent breastfeeding or pumping can cause milk to build up and lead to infection.
- **Breast engorgement**: Overfull breasts can create pressure and lead to blocked ducts.
- **Poor hygiene**: Inadequate cleaning of the breast area can introduce bacteria.

## Symptoms

Common symptoms of postpartum breast infections include:

- **Painful, swollen area on the breast**
- **Redness and warmth in the affected area**
- **Tenderness to touch**
- **Fever and chills**
- **Flu-like symptoms**: Fatigue and malaise may accompany the infection.

In some cases, an abscess (a pocket of pus) may form, leading to a very painful lump in the breast.

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis of mastitis is primarily based on a physical examination and the reported symptoms. Healthcare providers may assess the affected breast for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, and tenderness. In some cases, imaging tests may be used to check for abscess formation.

## Treatment

Treatment for postpartum breast infections typically includes:

- **Antibiotics**: Prescribed to combat the bacterial infection.
- **Pain relief**: Over-the-counter pain relievers can help alleviate discomfort.
- **Continued breastfeeding**: It is generally safe to continue breastfeeding during treatment, as this helps to empty the breast and reduce the risk of complications.
- **Drainage of abscesses**: If an abscess forms, a healthcare provider may need to drain it, often under local anesthesia.
